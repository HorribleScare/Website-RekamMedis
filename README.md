# 🏥 Medical Record Management System Source Code
This repository contains the source code and supporting files for a Medical Record Management System. The application is designed as a dynamic PHP-based web system to manage medical data such as patients, doctors, medical records, examinations, and reports, while providing a structured interface for administrative and user interaction.

The codebase follows real-world web development practices including modular PHP files, structured folder organization, database-driven content, and reusable UI components—making it a solid foundation for healthcare information system projects.

## 📦 Contents
This project includes:
- Multiple PHP pages for managing medical modules:
  - Patients (`pasien`)
  - Doctors (`dokter`)
  - Medical Records (`rekam_medis`)
  - Examinations (`pemeriksaan`)
  - Reports (`laporan`)
  - User authentication and access control
- Database SQL file for MySQL setup
- Configuration file for database connection
- Front-end templates and assets (CSS, JavaScript, images)
- Structured folder layout for maintainability and scalability

The project demonstrates how a medical information system can be built using PHP and MySQL with a clean and organized structure.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- PHP — server-side logic and dynamic page rendering  
- MySQL — database management and medical data storage  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript — front-end layout, styling, and interactivity  
- Modular PHP includes — reusable headers, footers, and UI components  

These technologies are combined to create a functional and data-driven medical record web application.

## 🚀 Features
- Dynamic CRUD operations for medical records
- Patient and doctor data management
- User authentication and role-based access
- Modular PHP structure for easy maintenance
- Database-driven healthcare information system

## 🔍 Project Overview
The Medical Record Management System was developed to demonstrate the implementation of a real-world healthcare web application. Each module represents a core feature commonly found in medical information systems, from patient registration to medical record documentation and reporting.

The project is suitable for learning purposes and as a foundation for further development in health information systems.
